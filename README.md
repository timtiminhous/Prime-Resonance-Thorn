# PrimeResonance Thorn

**A Discrete Computational Kernel for Manifold Resonance**

## Overview
This Einstein Toolkit (Cactus) Thorn implements a discrete kernel that maps primorial moduli (P4, P5, P6, etc.) to continuous manifold rotations. It bridges discrete number theory and continuous field physics, demonstrating that specific discrete phase mappings remain bounded and structurally consistent with the Fine Structure Constant ($\alpha^{-1}$) and the Golden Angle.

## Mathematical Foundation
The formal proofs validating the stability and boundedness of this kernel are verified in LEAN4 and available here:
